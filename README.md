# Transfer-Learning-TEGM
Implementation of Trans-TE-CLIME: A transfer learning method for high-dimensional transelliptical graphical models. Includes code, simulation results, tables, visualizations, and S&amp;P 500 analysis. Uses auxiliary data to boost accuracy, robust to non-normal/heavy-tailed data.
\subsection*{Additional simulation results}

We conduct additional simulation studies to further investigate the sensitivity of our method to the choice of the tolerance parameter \(\varepsilon_0\) in Algorithm \ref{algorithm2}. In these simulations, we set the sample size \(n = 100\), dimension \(p = 50\), number of auxiliary datasets \(K = 5\), and each auxiliary sample size \(n_k = 150\) for \(k \in [K]\). The cardinality of the informative source set \(\mathcal{A}\) is set to 4. For \(k \in \mathcal{A}\), each entry \(\Delta_{ij}^{(k)}\) is zero with probability 0.9 and nonzero with probability 0.1; nonzero entries are generated from \(\mathrm{Unif}[-r/p, r/p]\) with \(r = 10\). For \(k \notin \mathcal{A}\), we let \(\Delta_{ij}^{(k)} = 0.5\mathbf{I}(i = j) + \rho_{ij}\), where \(\rho_{ij} = 0\) with probability 0.7 and equals 0.4 with probability 0.3. The target precision matrix \(\boldsymbol{\Omega}\) is specified as a banded matrix: \(\omega_{ij} = 2 \times 0.5^{|i - j|} \mathbf{I}(|i - j| \le 5)\), for \(1 \le i,j \le p\). All results are based on 100 replications.  
All other settings are consistent with those used in the main simulation experiments.
